Revision Made Simple

Straightforward notes, hand-picked resources and smart study tools - all in one, easy-to-navigate place!

## About CourseNotes

CourseNotes is a free & open-source revision website for students, by students. We carefully curate notes, videos & resources and smart study tools to help students ace their exams.

CourseNotes was created by, and is primarily developed by, Oliver Potter, a GCSE student in the UK who specialises in computer science and photography. His aim is to build a better, more accessible place to share and gain academic knowledge that dodges the clutter and is worded in a way that can be understood by students.

## Why CourseNotes?

The internet is abundant with revision websites, but many:

- Are cluttered and outdated
- Are inconsistent and untrustworthy
- Are locked behind a paywall

We aim to fix all of this with:

- Clean and relevant notes
- Notes aligned with exam board specifications
- Free access

## Features

- Detailed notes across various subjects
- Easy-to-follow study materials
- Open source and student-driven
- Responsive design
- **Retrieval practice powered by [Orbit](https://withorbit.com/)**

## Courses

We currently have notes for the following courses

- GCSE Computer Science (OCR J277)
  - This course is currently **outdated** and is due to be overhauled soon!
- GCSE English Literature - Power & Conflict Poetry (AQA 8702/B/2)
