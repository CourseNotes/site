# Welcome to CourseNotes
CourseNotes is a free & open-source revision website for students, by students. We carefully curate notes, videos & resources and smart study tools to help students ace their exams. 

CourseNotes was created by, and is primarily developed by, Oliver Potter, a GCSE student in the UK who specialises in computer science and photography. His aim is to build a better, more accessible place to share and gain academic knowledge that dodges the clutter and is worded in a way that can be understood by students.

# Why CourseNotes?
The internet is abundant with revision websites, but many:
- Are cluttered and outdated
- Are inconsistent and untrustworthy
- Are locked behind a paywall

We aim to fix all of this with:
- Clean and relevant notes
- Notes aligned with exam board specifications
- Free access

# Want to Contribute?
As an open-source project, anyone is welcome to contribute new notes (regardless of programming knowledge) and features! If you'd like to help out, then please get in touch using the chat widget.
