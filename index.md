# Welcome to CourseNotes

CourseNotes is a revision website for students, by students. The site compiles concise & cohesive notes, videos & resources from subject area experts and interactive recall practice tools to help you ace your exams.

# Course Library

# Notes

Notes are written in a short, bullet-pointed format, with key information standing out. We align the structure of our notes with the exam board's specification, so you know what knowledge you need before you enter the exam hall. No need for a dictionary - all keywords and their definitions can be found at the top of each page!

# Videos & Resources

It has been shown that most learners prefer watching videos, rather than reading notes or listening to lectures. Note authors have compiled relevant videos from subject experts, which can be accessed alongside notes, for your convenience.

# Smart Recall Practice

CourseNotes utilises [Orbit](https://withorbit.com/) for retrieval practice. After you have read the notes for a particular topic, you will be presented with an optional Orbit review area. You will be prompted with a few flashcard-style questions to reinforce the concepts you have just learned about. Memory fades, so after a few days, Orbit will send you an email inviting you to quickly review the text’s questions. If you still remember an answer, you’ll next see it two weeks later. Then a month after that, then two months, and so on. If you forget an answer, the schedule contracts to reinforce that question.
