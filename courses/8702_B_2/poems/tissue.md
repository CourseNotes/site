# Introduction

Imtiaz Dharker's Tissue explores the fragility and power of paper as a metaphor for human life. The poem reflects on how paper shapes our world, yet is ultimately delicate and temporary. Dharker uses gentle imagery to suggest that human creations are not as permanent as we may think. Tissue invites readers to let go of control, embracing the transient, precious nature of life.

# Key Words

**Fragility** - easily broken or destroyed

**Structure** - to form into or according to a structure

**Transience** - passing especially quickly into and out of existence; always changing

**Metaphor** - a figure of speech in which a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is not literally applicable

**Identity** - the distinguishing character or personality of an individual

# Bigger Picture Idea

Imtiaz Dharker examines the concept of power by describing how paper, and its various usages, can be so fragile and yet yield the power to 'alter things' in much the same way as a mortal human life can.

# Analysis

### "the kind you find in well-used books, the back of the Koran"

This quote is symbolic of the power of paper in books, especially religious texts. The power of books can far outlast humanity's sense of power.

### "Paper that lets the light shine through, this is what could alter things"

The poem opens with an image of beauty and positivity, the idea that as long as we have light there is potential for change for the better. It has religious connotations; belief in God suggests redemption and purity.

### "pages smoothed and stroked and turned transparent with attention"

The paper is worn thin because it is used frequently. 'Turned transparent with attention' suggests that we can learn more and see deeper the more we examine our lives and grow mature. Paper controls how we live and outlasts us.

### "Fine slips from grocery shops that say how much was sold and what was paid by credit card might fly our lives like paper kites"

This simile explores the importance humanity places on paper. We value freedom but remain controlled like a kite. Receipts and money dictate how we live our lives. It shows how preoccupied we are with material goods. There is too much emphasis on unimportant things rather than working towards a greater good.

# Structure

A controlled structure (9 quatrains) could represent the control paper has over us and the knowledge it holds.

Enjambment is symbolic of the impact of paper.
