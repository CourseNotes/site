# Introduction

Carol Ann Duffy's War Photographer explores the emotional conflict faced by war photographers. The poem follows a photographer developing photos in a darkroom, reflecting on the horrors he has witnessed and the indifference of people back home. She contrasts the chaos of the battlefield with the safety of rural England. Throughout the poem, themes of suffering, guilt and detachment and present. Duffy questions the role of media and the impact of war on victims and observers.

# Key Words

**Contrast** - juxtaposition of dissimilar elements
**Detachment** - the state of being disconnected or uninvolved
**Atrocity** - a shockingly bad situation or event
**Darkroom** - a room with no light for developing photographs
**Guilt** - a feeling of responsibility for wrongdoing

# Bigger Picture Idea

Carol Ann Duffy examines the concept of distant wars, suffering and the 'hundred agonies' of those caught up in the conflict and questions the reasons behind the desensitisation of the western populous towards such atrocities.

# Analysis

### "All flesh is grass"

Priests who 'intone a mass' are typically associated with tragedies. The simile therefore reminds us of the grave consequences of war and the impact on those far away. It is a quote from the bible reflecting on the shortness of human life. It is also an extended metaphor examines the responsibility of a war photographer or anyone who profits from suffering.

### "running children in a nightmare heat"

'Running children' creates a pathos as children connote innocence. 'Nightmare heat' is emblematic of their childhood fears. This poem is inspired by Nick Ut's Pulitzer Prize winning photo of 'Napalm Girl', which may have been used as an allusion; a symbol of human tragedy and to shed a light upon innocent victims of war.

### "In his darkroom he is finally alone"

This quote emphasises the silence and solitude experienced by the photographer. The adverb 'finally' suggests that this is something he has longed for after the chaos and pain of war. The 'darkroom' could have a deeper, symbolic meaning. He has shut off the light, yet it could be a physical manifestation of the darkest recesses of his mind. The photographs are forcing him to revisit the trauma.

### "A hundred agonies in black-and-white"

The emotions behind each photo are complex and painful, full of powerlessness and hopelessness. Where before the photographer was giving victims of war a voice, the majority will be silenced because not all photographs will be chosen for publication.

### "From the aeroplane he stares impassively at where he earns his living and they do not care"

The photographer returns from the battlefield - as long as there is conflict, he is needed. The adverb 'impassively' shows he is used to people not caring. He will continue trying to find a solution, despite the fact that there are no solutions to war.

# Structure

The ABBCDD rhyming scheme imitates the rigidity of the photographer's job in contrast to his mind.

Caesura emphasises the harrowing effect his job has on him.

The poem's volta deploys analepsis.
