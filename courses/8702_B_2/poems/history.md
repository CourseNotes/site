# Introduction

John Agard's Checking Out Me History challenges the Eurocentric version of history taught in schools, highlighting how the important Black figures are often dismissed. The poem contrasts British historical figures with powerful African and Caribbean individuals using dialect-rich language to assert identity and reclaim history. Agard explores themes of power, education and cultural identity. He shows how history can be used to control or liberate.

# Key Words

**Identity** - the distinguishing character or personality of an individual

**Heritage** - properties that descend to offspring

**Colonialism** - domination of an area by a foreign state; the practice of extending a nation's control over another area

**Empowerment** - the granting of power to perform various acts

**Rebellion** - opposition to authority

# Bigger Picture Idea

John Agard examines the concept of identity and the impact of Eurocentric history and ideology on both the individual and society - and in doing so begins 'carving out his own identity'.

# Analysis

### "Dem tell me bout Columbus and 1492 but what happen to de Caribs and de Arawaks too"

Agard trivialises British history with nursery rhymes. The white European Columbus is generally hailed as the man who 'discovered' America, but Agard is more concerned with the indigenous people who were already there. Why were they not told their history? The 'white washing' of history immensely troubles Agard. He exposes the dishonesty of presenting an event in which white 'conquerors' repressed the indigenous people as heroic. History should not be manipulated to please western culture.

### "Dem tell me <br /> Dem tell me wha dem want to tell me <br /> Bandage up me eye with me own history"

An overwhelming sense that the speaker sees white history as some sort of propaganda for superiority. He feels manipulated by the content he is fed by the white education system. The usage of 'bandage' is ironic as it is used to blind instead of to heal.

### "Dem tell me bout 1066 and all dat"

This creates a sense of bitterness. The Battle of Hastings (1066) was a monumental event in British history. He is dismissive of it by using 'all dat'. Pairing '1066' with 'Dick Whittington' makes the education system seem almost laughable. Behind this sarcasm is a cry for help - he is terrified of losing all links to his own culture.

### "Toussaint a slave with vision"

Agard structures his poem so there is a space dedicated to black historical figures to represent their significance. His poem is used to educate. Each figure is used as a subtle criticism of white superiority.

### "Toussaint de thorn to de French <br /> Toussaint de beacon of de Haitian Revolution"

This is an extended metaphor of light. The 'beacon' has connotations of hope and salvation. He places them on a pedestal for those who may feel oppressed. These figures fought for what they believe in. Toussaint is a beacon for those who feel ignored, oppressed and persecuted.

### "a healing star among the wounded <br /> a yellow sunrise"

This is another extended metaphor of light. Agard is symbolically shining light on his own heroes of different ethnicities. It suggests some sort of celestial guidance. It is 'unblinding' him from the limitations of English education. The figures guide the speaker; he perceives their achievements as enlightening and warming.

### "But now I checking out me own history <br /> I carving out me identity"

'Carving' in the present tense indicates that he is in the process of re-educating himself. It suggests a sense of permanence and will be left with an identity he can call his own that cannot be ignored or dismissed.

# Structure

Rhyme ties together the sections about white and black history, showing how he wants to end segregation through literary unification.

Enjambment is used to tie together black and white history, suggesting it cannot be separated and ignored.
