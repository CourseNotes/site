# Introduction

Jane Weir's Poppies explores the emotional impact of war from a mother's perspective, illustrating the pain of letting her son go off to fight. Domestic imagery and military references are blended to show how conflict affects families far away from the battlefield. Rich symbolism is used to express themes of loss, memory and longing.

# Bigger Picture Idea

Jane Weir examines the concept of grief and suffering by exploring the impact of war on the maternal speaker and by extension the families of all soldiers who leave behind their loved ones to reminisce over 'individual war graves'.

# Analysis

### "the gelled blackthorns of your hair"

Weir uses imagery which is homely and domesticated but also highlights the reality of war. The noun 'blackthorns' innocently shows a young boy taking care of his appearance but can also be read as an allusion to Jesus' crown of thorns. The longevity of the relic's survival can also be symbolic of the mother's memories of her son. She is worried about the potential sacrifice her son could be forced to make. Vulnerability and innocence can align them with christ.

### "Three days before Armistice Sunday and poppies had already been placed on individual war graves"

Weir immediately foregrounds themes of war, death and personal loss. It is cut short by the caesura in line 3, just like the lives of the soldiers. Illustrates the concerns and fears if the speaker as she sends her son to war.

### "spasms of paper red, disrupting a blockade of yellow bias binding around your blazer"

The poppy is unusually violent. 'Spasm' has connotations of a dying soldier and contrasts with the gentle image. 'Blockade' hints that their relationship is put on hold. 'Blazer' makes the son seem young and vulnerable.

### "Sellotape bandaged around my hand"

This alludes to the brutal consequences of war. It shows the mother's maternal duty to care for her son. 'Sellotape' is juxtaposed with 'bandaged' to show the different paths the mother and her son are taking. Her life's purpose is to care for him.

### "the front door, threw it open, the world overflowing like a treasure chest"

'Treasure chest' has connotations of adventure - it emphasises the son's naivety. The son lacks life experience as his mother has always protected him. This acts as an allusion to Pandora's Box - the house is safe but when the door is opened, he is not protected.

# Structure

Free verse mimics the unstructured thoughts of a grieving mother.

Enjambment is symbolic of a mother passionately lamenting the loss of her child.
