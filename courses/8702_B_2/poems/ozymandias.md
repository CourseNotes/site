# Introduction

Percy Bysshe Shelley's Ozymandias is a sonnet exploring the themes of power, pride and the decline of rulers. The narrator describes a ruined statue in a desert that once belonged to a kind who believed his empire would be everlasting. However, time has erased his legacy and the remains of the statue stand as a reminder of human arrogance and the fleeting power of nature.

# Key Words

**Tyranny** - a government in which absolute power is vested in a single ruler

**Legacy** - the long lasting impact of a particular event or person

**Hubris** - exaggerated pride or self-confidence

**Ruin** - to damage irreparably

**Impermanence** - the quality or state of not being permanent

# Bigger Picture Idea

Percy Shelley examines the concept of the transient nature of power through an allegorical depiction of the boastful, hubristic and narcissistic Ramses II and the limitations of his 'cold command' and authoritarian rule.

# Analysis

### "Ozymandias" - the title

'Ozy' comes from the Greek 'ozium' which means either 'to breathe' or 'air'. 'Mandias' comes from the Greek 'mandate' which means to rule, suggesting Ramses II, the inspiration for Shelley's poem, controls all.

### "stamped on these lifeless things"

Shelley's ridicule of the pharaoh's arrogant boast could be veiled condemnation of the government under George III. The poet abhorred oppressive monarchical government, favouring revolution. This could act as a warning that Britain could expect the same if it didn't change. The king's sons were objects of public scorn amd the country was run for selfish interests. People are hungry and oppressed - the army stamps on the proletariat and destroys liberty.

### "Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown and wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command"

The 'frown' and 'sneer' etched permanently on the face of the statue could represent the ugliness that power can reveal in people when they wield it. Shelley is criticising the oppressive nature of power.

### "its sculptor well those passions read which yet survive"

The traveller praises the sculptor saying they have clearly captured the facial expressions Ozymandias is renowned for. Shelley is praising and respectful of the 'art' of the statue whilst condemning Ozymandias' attitude and lust for power. He is saying that it is the work of the sculptor that has endured the test of time.

### "'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'"

The hubristic nature of Ozymandias demonstrates his arrogance and perceived superiority, placing himself above other rulers. Iambic pentameter creates a strong rhythm for a strong leader. It demonstrates that art and language can long outlast other legacies of power.

# Structure

Shelley uses the sonnet form which is associated with love to evoke Ozymandias' narcissism.

The rhyme scheme becomes even more irregular throughout the poem, emphasising the degradation of power.
