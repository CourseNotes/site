# Introduction

Beatrice Garland's Kamikaze explores the conflict between duty and personal conscience through the story of a Japanese Kamikaze pilot who chooses to turn back rather than completing his suicide mission. The poem reflects on his family's shame and silence, highlighting the emotional cost of honour and patriotism. Garland uses natural imagery and shifting perspectives to contrast the beauty of life with the expectation of self-sacrifice. The poem raises questions of identity, legacy and human instinct.

# Key Words

**Honour** - a 'good name' or public admiration

**Shame** - a painful emotion caused by consciousness of guilt

**Patriotism** - love or devotion to one's country

**Conflict** - to be different, opposed or contradictory

**Legacy** - the long lasting impact of a particular event or person

# Bigger Picture Idea

Beatrice Garland examines the concept of patriotism and loyalty by creating the voice of a granddaughter who reflects upon the idea of martyrdom and the incomprehensible decisions of her grandfather who himself was a Kamikaze pilot.

# Analysis

### "a shaven head full of powerful incantations"

Being described as 'full of powerful incantations' creates a sense that the pilot has been bewitched by the Japanese Empire's propaganda and is convinced this is a noble mission. 'Shaven head' can reference the strict adherence to the Bushido Code but also to his purity and dignity of death. The Bushido Code outlines 8 virtues including justice, courage, honour and loyalty. It may allude to the Kamikaze propaganda which romanticised the ancient Samurai warrior culture.

### "Her father embarked at sunrise with a flask of water, a samurai sword"

This creates a contrast between suffering and peace. The use of sibilance could be treated as sinister or peaceful. 'Sunrise' connotes peace, yet 'samurai sword' would connote violence. The pilot is at peace as he travels over the sea but he is on his way to extreme violence and death.

### "arcing in swathes like a huge flag waved first one way then the other in a figure of eight"

The reference to a flag is also a reference to patriotism and also surrender. The 'figure of eight' is a clear reference to the idea of eternal life, reminding the pilot of what he is sacrificing. Perhaps he is looking down and thinking it is more important to live.

### "with cloud-marked mackerel, black crabs, feathery prawns"

The narrator brings us back to the sky. The pilot could be asking if this is a natural way to die - it is unnatural to find mackerel in the clouds. It sounds wrong, like the pilot's situation.

### "a tuna, the dark prince, muscular, dangerous"

This offers parallels with fish caught in nets and the trappings of war. 'Dark prince' conjures images of something more sinister. 'Prince' could be alluding to the Emperor, who has commanded the pilots to sacrifice themselves. It is corrupt and a betrayal - not a pure way to die.

### "only we children still chattered and laughed"

Represents the power of tradition and societal expectations. Despite wanting to cling to the world, his life is not worth living. The judgemental characteristics of adulthood are juxtaposed with childhood naivety. As children, they are unaware of this expectation, only learning with age and experience.

### "he must have wondered which had been the better way to die"

What is an honourable way to die? If a samurai was facing defeat, an honourable death would be suicide. Did he end his life to end the shame forced upon him? Samurais who killed themselves would have been ordered to do so. They are already treating him like he should be dead.

# Structure

The controlled stanza structure (seven sestets) could be symbolic of the patriotic indoctrination.

Enjambment could denote how passionately he felt and how quickly memories flooded his mind.
