# Introduction

Alfred Lord Tennyson's The Charge of the Light Brigade is a poem commemorating the bravery of British soldiers during the Crimean War. It recounts how the Light Brigade followed a flawed command, charging into their death. Themes of honour, duty and sacrifice highlight the soldiers' unwavering courage. Whilst acknowledging the tragic loss, the poem ultimately celebrates the soldiers' heroism and loyalty.

# Key Words

**Honour** - a 'good name' or public admiration

**Patriotism** - love or devotion for one's country

**Sabre** - cavalry sword with a curved blade, thick back, and guard

**Blunder** - to make a mistake through stupidity, ignorance or carelessness

**Cavalry** - an army component mounted on horseback

# Bigger Picture Idea

Alfred Lord Tennyson examines the concept of chivalry and self sacrifice through his depiction of the Light Brigade's 'glory', subservience and loyalty in the Crimean War and as a by-produce romanticises, glamourises and enthrones war.

# Analysis

### "Some one had blunder'd"

The use of the word 'blundered' is pertinent as it mirrors an editorial in the Times from 1854. He is appalled at the loss of life as a result of human error. Tennyson is not impressed with the higher authority yet avoids directly blaming one person.

### "Half a league onward, all in the valley of Death"

This is a biblical allusion from psalm 23, suggesting horror and segregation from god. It is a reference to the stoical bravery of the soldiers - they knew they were going to die, but do not fear it and fulfil their patriotic duty.

### "Cannon to the right of them, cannon to the left of them, cannon in front of them"

The usage of anaphora emphasises the impossible odds that these men are fighting against. A cannon has destructive potential. The men are being herded by the enemy and are likely to die wherever they go.

### "Into the jaws of Death, into the mouth of Hell"

This biblical allusion suggests these soldiers are completely consumed by the hellish realities of war. Fate and the fact that their deaths are inevitable become strikingly clear. Blunder is closing around them and they cannot escape it.

### "All that was left of them"

A tragic image portrays this unified force as broken and fragile. It shows the unwavering and resolute manner in which the men complete their orders. A poignant tribute to those who had no choice but to ride to their deaths.

### "Honour the charge they made! Honour the Light Brigade, noble six hundred!"

This quote uses imperatives. The poem never differentiates between those who did and did not survive. They are united in their patriotism and duty and should be respected and acknowledged.

# Structure

Together with the use of dactylic dimeter, in which the heavy stress falls on monosyllabic words, auditory imagery and momentum of cavalry charge is created.

A shift in structure reflects their desperate attempt to retreat. We are reminded of the soldiers' heroism.
